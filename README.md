# Introduction
AgroVest is a new way to invest in the agricultural industry by allowing users to lodge in their funds in different categories like bronze, silver, gold, and diamond. The invested funds are then used to work on different sectors of agriculture, including crop farming, livestock farming, fishery, and other relevant sectors. The rewards earned from this investment are then distributed to the user based on the category they have invested into. This provides investors with the opportunity to diversify their investment portfolio, support the growth and development of the agricultural industry, and earn passive income.
