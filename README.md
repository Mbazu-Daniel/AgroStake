# Introduction
Agricultural staking is a new way to invest in the agricultural industry by allowing users to stake their funds in different categories like basic, silver, gold, and diamond. The staked funds are then used to work on different sectors of agriculture, including crop farming, livestock farming, fishery, and other relevant sectors. The rewards earned from staking are then distributed to the user based on the category they have staked in. This provides investors with the opportunity to diversify their investment portfolio, support the growth and development of the agricultural industry, and earn passive income through staking.
